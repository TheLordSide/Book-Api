# API FOR BOOK
## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10.4
#### pip 22.1 from C:\Users\Sidewinder\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.10)
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/plants_api` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
