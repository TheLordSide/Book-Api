# 1-Project detail
This project is a class project given us by Mr OURO. The goals of this project can be summarized in these points:
- You need to build your API using python Flask / base
Postgres data
- You should document your API specifying the responses you
get after running each endpoint
- Deploy your API on the Heroku Cloud Platform

# 2-Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10.4
#### pip 22.1 from C:\Users\Sidewinder\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.10)
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Packages used
The requiered package.txt inside the tree structure contains all the requierd packages you need to use the API.

```bash
BOOK-API/
|----.gitignore
|----API_BIBLIOTHEQUE.postman_collection.json
|----Bookapi.py
|----README.md
|----requieredpackage.txt 





#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/plants_api` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
